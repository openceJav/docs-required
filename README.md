## About This Documentation

This documentation is a simple collection of file and documents that are required for most open source, contribution based projects. The idea is to have a single repository with all the necessary files to copy and paste into new projects. This just makes it easier to kick-start them without having to worry about things like CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, etc.

I'm sure there are other ways to do this, and there are plenty of templates online that you can use, but I much prefer having a single repository that can be cloned and copied with everyone in a single place rather than having to explore the internet for them one by one.

## Installation & Usage

To use this repo, simply clone it and copy the files you need into your own projects. I usually put them in a folder called `docs/` in the root of the repo, but you can put them wherever you see best fit. 
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

To copy the files, you can use the following commands:
```bash
cp -r docs-required/CONTRIBUTING.md <your-project>/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md
cp -r docs-required/LICENSE <your-project>/docs/LICENSE
cp -r docs-required/README.md <your-project>/docs/README.md
...
```

or just drag and drop them all into your project. I would recommend to delete the `.git` folder and the `assets/` folder as they are not needed in your project, alongside the README.md since it is specific to this repo and this repo only.
